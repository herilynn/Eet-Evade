The user will be controlling a wild eevee that is trying to reach a sanctuary. However, the sanctuary is quite far so it needs to eat the berries along the way. However, if it doesn't eat enough berries at each stage; it will starve and the game is over. Maintaining a full belly isn't the only thing however. It also needs to avoid trainers trying to catch/battle it. This would be indicated by pokeballs (red/blue/yellow/purple). If your character gets hit by a purple (masterball); game would automatically end and you'll be at the mercy of whoever owns it. While red/blue/yellow (poke/great/ultra) balls won't capture you; it WILL take away time from your timer if they hit you as you waste time resisting capture; red < blue < yellow in terms of amount of time. HOWEVER; that's not the ONLY thing about the balls. If the balls are shaking; DON'T attack it as a pokemon can come out and will attack you and also waste your timer. In other words; AVOID the balls and just let them hit the floor. Not all items are hazards though. There are evolution stones that will occasionally fall down which will evolve your eevee into one of 3 possible eeveelutions (flareon; fire(red), vaporeon; water(blue), and jolteon; electric(yellow)). All have their own unique special moves which have a wider range than the normal special move eevee has access to. Using these special moves will use your PP; think of it as your energy which can be refueled by eating more berries. Along with getting better moves; you also get access to a multiplier on amount of points the berries give you as well as giving you invulerability to (non-shaking pokeballs (red); meaning they won't consume time from your timer). However, great(blue), ultra(yellow), and master(purple) will still affect you. Ultra balls actually would knock the evolution out of you; reverting you back to an eevee. Therefore; avoid balls in general still but definitely avoid yellow and purple. Along with these 3 evolution stones; there's 1 other stone; an everstone (gray). This will devolve you back to eevee; it won't take away from your timer. The point of this can be counted as a hazard or a way for you to devolve and choose a different evolution stone. There will be 3 lvls; the 1st lvl will just be 30 seconds. Level 2 will be 45 and level 3 will be 60. If you manage to meet the required amount of points for each level without capture; you will successfully make it to the PokeParadise. So good luck Eevading and Eeting as much berries along the way!
